**Exercise 1**\
**Using Git**

In this exercise, you elaborate on Git. First, you’ll need to imagine a small software application project to work with. Of course, you can also use one of your own projects if there is no security or privacy issues involved. You’ll also need to create your own GitHub or BitBucket project in case you don’t already have one.
Embed your theory answers, drawings, codes and screenshots directly into this document. Always immediately after the relevant question. Return the document into your return box in ~~the Optima~~ itsLearning platform by the deadline.
The maximum number of points you can earn from this exercise is 10. Each finished task is worth of 1 point.
This exercise must be done individually or in pairs. Remember to return the document into ~~the Optima~~ itsLearning return box by the agreed deadline.

- 1. Explain what for what Git version control is meant for. List also the main benefits of using version control in application development.
- 2. Install Git on your local computer. Document the process with screenshots and/or text.
- 3. Explain the following Git and version control related concepts:
      - a. A working directory
      - b. A staging area
      - c. A local repository
      - d. A remote repository
      - e. A commit
      - f. A branch
- 4. Initialize one of your programming projects in your local computer as git project. Display it status. Take a screenshot of the status message.
- 5. Write a short example of a .gitignore file. What is the purpose of that file? When you should add it?
- 6. Work locally with working area and staging area and make a few commits. Pay special attention on good commits’ comments. Take screenshots documenting your working process. Take also a screenshot of your git log.
- 7. Create an account to GitHub or BitBucket. Take a screenshot that proofs that you have an account. Explain also what GitHub and BitBucket are.
- 8. Push the contents of your local Git repository to your GitHub or BitBucket. Document the commands you used here. Add also a screenshot documenting your code on Net. Imagine that you were another user working on the project. How would you get the remote repository from GitHub or BitBucket on your own computer? Give the Git command.
- 9. Use branches to work with your code. Explain the benefits of using branches. Give also the Git commands you used. Make also certain that you merge at least one branch to another. Document also this command or command chain here.
- 10. What are pull requests? What are the benefits they can offer? Give a scenario of using pull requests. Take also a screenshot from you GitHub or BitBucket account that proves your capability to create and work with them.
