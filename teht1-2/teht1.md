## Chapter 1: Exercises ##

### 1.1 Explain why the fundamental software engineering principles of process, dependability, requirements management, and reuse are relevant to all types of software systems. (2 points) ###

> "software systems can quickly become extremely complex, difficult to understand, and expensive to change."

Nowdays systems have to be built and delivered more quickly and their requirements tend to be bigger so that even more complex systems are required. The demand for newly build systems capabilities are something that not that long ago would have been thought to be impossible. Up to date software engineering techniques have to meet new the challenges of delivering more and more complex software.

Good software engineering techniques help us to build larger, more complex systems that are more easily maintained and if necessary modified. [[Sommerville, Ian.

### 1.2 Explain with some examples, why different application types require specialized software engineering techniques to support their design and development. (2 points) ### 

  The real life applications may have very different requirements that benefit different kind of specialized software engineering techniques. The required maturity of the codebase can be much different based on what is being developed.
  
  Developers (good developer anyway) of course aim to write lasting and easily maintained code, but it's much different to develop something with language that is still in the making and with framework that is 2+ years old and publishes new major releases in one to three years. On the other hand you can have some well adapt coding language with steady environment that has built a critical product that on best/worst case scenario has been up and running for years with steady number of users.

  The goals to what you're are aiming might vary big time. If you're part of a team that is developing a web store you might aim for continues development that publishes changes even hourly and agree that bugs even if you try to avoid them sometimes exist and are things that are at some point of the process unavoidable. The question becomes more about how to catch them quicly and avoid the really big and business critical boo-boos and mishaps. 

  On the other hand think about a big airline company and it's development team. The team is developing the latest state of the art software for airplanes. In that environment a bug, even a small one can be fatal and the whole development process is meet with certainly diffrent kind of requirements. 


### 1.3 What is the main difference between custom software development and generic software product development? In which kind of software development have you participated in? (1 point) ### 


## Chapter 2: Exercises ##

### 2.1. Suggest the most appropriate generic software process model that might be used as a basis for managing the development of the following systems. Explain your answer according to the type of system being developed: ###

- 1) A system to control antilock braking in a car;
  
  **Embedded control systems** These are software control systems that control and manage hardware devices. Numerically, there are probably more embedded systems than any other type of system. Examples of embedded systems include the software in a mobile (cell) phone, software that controls antilock braking in a car, and software in a microwave oven to control the cooking process.

- 2) A virtual reality system to support software maintenance;
  Systems for modeling and simulation These are systems that are developed by scientists and engineers to model physical processes or situations, which include many separate, interacting objects. These are often computationally intensive and require high-performance parallel systems for execution.

- 3) A university accounting system that replaces an existing system;
  Batch processing systems These are business systems that are designed to process data in large batches. They process large numbers of individual inputs to create corresponding outputs. Examples of batch systems are periodic billing systems, such as phone billing systems, and salary payment systems.

- 4) An interactive travel planning system that helps users plan journeys with the lowest environmental impact. (2 points)
  Interactive transaction-based applications These are applications that execute on a remote computer and that are accessed by users from their own computers, phones, or tablets. Obviously, these include web applications such as e-commerce applications where you interact with a remote system to buy goods and services. This class of application also includes business systems, where a business provides access to its systems through a web browser or special-purpose client program and cloud-based services, such as mail and photo sharing. Interactive applications often incorporate a large data store that is accessed and updated in each transaction.

### 2.2 How can you cope with change in software projects (1 point) ###
A fundamental precept of traditional software engineering is that you should design for change. That is, you should anticipate future changes to the software and design it so that these changes can be easily implemented. Extreme programming, however, has discarded this principle on the basis that designing for change is often wasted effort. It isnâ€™t worth taking time to add generality to a program to cope with change. Often the changes anticipated never materialize, or completely different change requests may actually be made.
