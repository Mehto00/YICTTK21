### 1.1 Explain why the fundamental software engineering principles of process, dependability, requirements management, and reuse are relevant to all types of software systems. (2 points) ###

> "software systems can quickly become extremely complex, difficult to understand, and expensive to change."

Nowdays systems have to be built and delivered more quickly and their requirements tend to be bigger so that even more complex systems are required. The demand for newly build systems capabilities are something that not that long ago would have been thought to be impossible. Up to date software engineering techniques have to meet new the challenges of delivering more and more complex software.

Good software engineering techniques help us to build larger, more complex systems that are more easily maintained and if necessary modified. [[Sommerville, Ian.

### 1.2 Explain with some examples, why different application types require specialized software engineering techniques to support their design and development. (2 points) ### 

  The real life applications may have very different requirements that benefit different kind of specialized software engineering techniques. The required maturity of the codebase can be much different based on what is being developed.
  
  Developers (good developer anyway) of course aim to write lasting and easily maintained code, but it's much different to develop something with language that is still in the making and with framework that is 2+ years old and publishes new major releases in one to three years. On the other hand you can have some well adapt coding language with steady environment that has built a critical product that on best/worst case scenario has been up and running for years with steady number of users.

  The goals to what you're are aiming might vary big time. If you're part of a team that is developing a web store you might aim for continues development that publishes changes even hourly and agree that bugs even if you try to avoid them sometimes exist and are things that are at some point of the process unavoidable. The question becomes more about how to catch them quicly and avoid the really big and business critical boo-boos and mishaps. 

  On the other hand think about a big airline company and it's development team. The team is developing the latest state of the art software for airplanes. In that environment a bug, even a small one can be fatal and the whole development process is meet with certainly diffrent kind of requirements. 


### 1.3 What is the main difference between custom software development and generic software product development? In which kind of software development have you participated in? (1 point) ### 


## Chapter 2: Exercises ##

### 2.1. Suggest the most appropriate generic software process model that might be used as a basis for managing the development of the following systems. Explain your answer according to the type of system being developed: ###

- 1) A system to control antilock braking in a car; 
- 2) A virtual reality system to support software maintenance; 
- 3) A university accounting system that replaces an existing system; 
- 4) An interactive travel planning system that helps users plan journeys with the lowest environmental impact. (2 points)
